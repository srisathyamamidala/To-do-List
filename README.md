### Project Description

To-do-List application is to display the to do list of the user which changes from day to day. Here the user initially create an account by registering and login into the account. The welcome page is displayed now to the user. There will be a button of adding the to do's. So the user clicks it and add the to do's for that particular day. The user will be able to update the list. This list will be stored and displayed to the user whenever the user login into the account. When the user completes the task for that day user can just click the check box of that particular task so that task will be eliminated from that list and the remaining tasks will be displayed. The user also gets the number of remaining tasks for that day and that number changes when the user do the task and clicks the check box.
